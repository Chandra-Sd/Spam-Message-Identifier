# Spam-Message-Identifier
Identifying and distinguishing spam massages using the multinomial Na√Øve Bayes model
what is Naive Bayes classifier
Naive Bayes classifier to identify and distinguish spam messages. This is a common and effective approach for text classification tasks.

Here's a brief summary of the key components in my project:

Types of Naive Bayes Classifiers:

1.ernoulli Naive Bayes
2.Categorical Naive Bayes
3.Complement Naive Bayes
4.Gaussian Naive Bayes
5.Multinomial Naive Bayes
6.Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier:

Used for text classification, where data is represented as word vector counts or TF-IDF vectors.
Parameters are estimated using a smoothed version of maximum likelihood.
Dataset Used:

The smsSpamCollection dataset was used to train the model.
The dataset can be accessed from: SMS Spam Collection
Model Performance Metrics:

Accuracy: 99.01%
Precision: 97.89%
Recall: 94.56%
Confusion Matrix:

A confusion matrix was used to observe the performance of the model.
Steps Involved:

Importing libraries
Uploading dataset
Creating the DataFrame
Splitting the data
Vectorizing the data
Training and predicting
Calculating accuracy, precision, and recall
Calculating the confusion matrix
Testing the model with a new SMS/Email message
Visualization:


I have mentioned that there are steps in the Jupyter Notebook file. Users can refer to the notebook for a more detailed walkthrough.
We can use the confusion matrix to observe the performance of our model:
